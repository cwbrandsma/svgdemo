# SVG Demo

This project is intended as a hosting location for any SVG samples I'm working through at the time.

## Demos
* index.html: shapes and properties
* text.html:  drawing text in interesting (annoying) ways
* shapereuse.html:  how to define a shape and reuse it
* viewbox.html:  show what the viewbox is and how to play with it.
* animate.html:  play with simple animation, create svg elements in javascript


## Notes
* These demos are currently using raw javascript
* In production, I use a library called D3, but you really need to know svg first to use it
* But I'm not against using Raphiel...I just haven't (I can only learn one library at a time)
